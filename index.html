        <h3 align="middle">Project Summary</h3>
        <p>insert project summary</p>

	    
        <h3 align="middle">Problem Description</h3>
        <p>Here you should provide the context for your idea. Describe the problem that you are trying to solve, 
            why it is important, where it is challenging. Give us a general idea on how you are going to solve it.</p>
           
        <h3 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h3>
        <h4 align="left">What We Plan to Deliver</h4>
        <p>describe what you believe you must accomplish to have a successful project and achieve the grade you 
            expect (i.e. your baseline plan -- planning for some unexpected problems would make sense)</p>
            
        <h4 align="left">What We Hope to Deliver</h4>
        <p>describe what you hope to achieve if things go well and you get ahead of schedule (your aspirational plan)</p>
        
        <h3 align="middle">Schedule</h3>
        <p>In this section you should organize and plan the tasks and subtasks that your team will execute. Since 
            presentations are ~4 weeks from the due-date of the proposal, you should include a set of tasks for every week.</p>
        
        <h3 align="middle>Resources</h3>
        <p>List what resources, e.g. books, papers and/or online resources that are references for your project. List the 
            computing platform, hardware and software resources that you will use for your project. You have a wide latitude 
            here to use what you have access to, but be aware that you will have to support and trouble-shoot on your 
            platform yourselves. If you are starting from an existing piece of code or system, describe and provide a pointer 
            to it here.</p>
