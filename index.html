        <h3 align="middle">Project Summary</h3>
        <p>For our project, we plan on implementing an animation that utilizes spacial keyframes to add movement to a scene. 
	    This also speeds up the process of animators adding movements to their characters since they can use less keyframes 
	    and add fluidity to the animation. Our project group is Riya Kumar, Mylinh Vu, and Ali.</p>

	    
        <h3 align="middle">Problem Description</h3>
        <p>Here you should provide the context for your idea. Describe the problem that you are trying to solve, 
            why it is important, where it is challenging. Give us a general idea on how you are going to solve it.</p>
	<p>Often times, animators have to implement many frame images to get their idea and art to come to life with movement. With 
		their drawings, there are often times that the movemnet doesn't seem fluid which takes away from the scene so this 
		implementation should ease these problems and allow it to be more efficient to build an animation. We are essentially 
		trying to interpolate the points between images to create a fluid motion for the animation. This is important to allow 
		more people to connect with the art of animation and ease the creativity process with the increase effeciency of making 
		an animation. The challenging part will be deciding how to interpolate these points and how to constanly update the 
		points to update on the screen with fluidity. Between two images could have a lot of subimages to create the animation and 
		we believe the tough part will be interpolating the points at the correct rates to achieve the fluid animation. To 
		implement our idea, we plan on utilizing radial basis interpolation that will help give the interpolation points that should 
		achieve the fluidity and orthonormalization to ensure the rotation matrix for certain movmenets is correct so the images 
		don't warp and appear correctly. If we have time, we would also like to implement reverse kinematics to add the lifelike and 
		realistic physical animations that would normally occur in real life.</p>
           
        <h3 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h3>
        <h4 align="left">What We Plan to Deliver</h4>
        <p>describe what you believe you must accomplish to have a successful project and achieve the grade you 
            expect (i.e. your baseline plan -- planning for some unexpected problems would make sense)</p>
	We are going to create a performance driven animation using spacial key framing. The character will be a penguin. He will have 4 key frames
	    that he rotates between for motion. Then penguin will follow the movement of the mouse around the screen. </p>
            
        <h4 align="left">What We Hope to Deliver</h4>
        <p>describe what you hope to achieve if things go well and you get ahead of schedule (your aspirational plan)</p>
        
        <h3 align="middle">Schedule</h3>
        <p>In this section you should organize and plan the tasks and subtasks that your team will execute. Since 
            presentations are ~4 weeks from the due-date of the proposal, you should include a set of tasks for every week.</p>
	<p>Week 1: Figuring out files we need to have as our skeleton code. We might want to have the userface able to move in the 3D space to see 
		the figure that are moving for the keypoints. We also want to figure out what files and libraries are needed to achieve our goal.</p>
	<p>Week 2: Continuing to build our basic code without the implementation of the concepts and algorithms for the spacial keyframing and 
		find or build some test files for our code so we know what the keyframes are and what a final implementation should look like.</p>
	<p>Week 3: Understand and implement radial basis function and orthonormalization from our base code with the matrices and values. Our code 
		should start outputting fluid animations or attempts to.</p>
	<p>Week 4: Debug our project and work on the webpage of our final implementation that explains our process and challenges.</p>
        
        <h3 align="middle>Resources</h3>
        <p>List what resources, e.g. books, papers and/or online resources that are references for your project. List the 
            computing platform, hardware and software resources that you will use for your project. You have a wide latitude 
            here to use what you have access to, but be aware that you will have to support and trouble-shoot on your 
            platform yourselves. If you are starting from an existing piece of code or system, describe and provide a pointer 
            to it here.</p>
