        <h3 align="middle">Project Progress So Far</h3>
        <p>We have two major points of accomplishment so far. For one, we have designed and rigged our penguin model. We found inspiration from the internet,
          but this task was exciting and challenging. It was some member's of the group's first time using Blender, so familiarizing ourselves with the software
      was tricky at first. However, we are confident we have gained the neccesary skills to proceed with the project!  </p>
      
      <p> Our second accomplishment is we wrote four files we will need pertaining to spatial keyframing and the radial base function. We have set up
        data structures that we will need to apply into the radial basis. We have also implemented a calculating the algorithm based on techniques by 
        various scholars including Igarashi, Moscovich, and Hughes. This was challenging aswell but with guidance from various resources, we were able
        to get a firm conceptual understanding of the concepts. </p>

	    
        <h3 align="middle">Preliminary Results</h3>
        <p>Though our preliminary results do not include animation, we have produced a static penguin. We have also added limits so that the model does not
      over rotate or intersect with itself. Once we implement the main function we will be able to see some animation.  </p>
