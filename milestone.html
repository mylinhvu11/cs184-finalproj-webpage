        <h3 align="middle">Project Progress So Far</h3>
        <p>I'm excited to share that we've made significant progress on our project.
		We've successfully designed and rigged our penguin model, which was a challenging task. 
		While we found inspiration from the internet, but the task was still quite challenging. As some of us were new to Blender,
		we had to put in extra effort to learn and become familiar with the software.
		However, we feel confident that we have gained the necessary skills to proceed with the project!</p>
      
      <p> Secondly, we've written four crucial files related to spatial keyframing and the radial base function. We've established the required data structures that we'll use in the radial basis and implemented
	      an algorithm based on techniques by renowned scholars such as Igarashi, Moscovich, and Hughes. 
	      Although it was a challenging task, we utilized various resources to gain a firm conceptual understanding of the concepts. 
	      We're pleased with our progress and confident in our abilities to move forward with the project. </p>

	    
        <h3 align="middle">Preliminary Results</h3>
        <p>Though our preliminary results do not include animation, we have produced a static penguin. We have also added limits so that the model does not
      over rotate or intersect with itself. Once we implement the main function we will be able to see some animation.  </p>
	    
	<h3 align="middle">Progress so Far</h3>
	<p>During the first week, we successfully identified the necessary files and data structures required for keyframe animations, as well as the essential 
		libraries for implementing the algorithms. However, we still need to determine how to import a Blender 3D model, including its rigging, into our 
		system. In the second week, we made progress by further developing our core code, incorporating special keyframing implementation. Our next step 
		is to build test files or create keyframe poses that will enable smooth transitions in the animation. For the third week, we have already 
		implemented radial basis functions and spatial keyframing. Although we have completed tasks across our targeted weeks, some tasks remain due to 
		the practical order of implementation. Thus, it was more sensible to complete certain tasks before others.</p>

	<h3 align="middle">Updated Work Plan</h3>

	<p>Week 3: Understand and implement radial basis function and orthonormalization from our base code with the matrices and values. Our code should start outputting 
		fluid animations or attempts to. Have the userface able to move in the 3D space to see. </p>

	<p>Week 4: Create poses we are satisfied with on our 3D articulated model penguin and mark them as new spatial key frames. Debug our project and work on the webpage 
		of our final implementation that explains our process and challenges.</p>
